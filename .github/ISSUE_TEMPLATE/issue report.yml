        When providing logs, please keep the following things in mind.
        1. **DO NOT** use external paste services.
        2. Please provide complete logs.
          - For server logs, include everything you think is important plus *10 lines before and after*
          - For ffmpeg logs, please provide the entire file unmodified.
        3. Please do not run logs through any translation program. Especially beware if your browser translates pages by default.
        4. Please do not include logs as screenshots, with the only exception being client logs in browsers.
